## **What is MBVA?**
Medical Billing Virtual Assistant or MBVA is a machine learning package that helps map medical notes to medical billing codes. This package is developed by four graduate students from the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley, for their capstone project. MBVA uses a pretrained model, which is mainly based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and MIMIC-III dataset, to analyze and examine medical notes. More details can be found under page **“Methodology”**.


## **What can I do with MBVA?**
MBVA uses advanced machine learning models to accurately and quickly identify medical information from your medical documents.You can use MBVA to identify the most likely medical billing codes for the medical treatments that the patient has had. 


## **What are the most common use cases for MBVA?**
The machine learning models behind MBVA can have wide applications to the current medical billing process in the U.S. 
* Patients - Want to have more transparency and the ability to self-audit their medical bills.
* Physicians - Desire for uniformity of billing and spending less time on billing related activities
* Insurers - Desire to automate the audit of suspicious billing practices and for uniformity of claims for identical clinical care
* Medical Billers - Wish to reduce audit-risk and prevent resubmission of claims as well as for uniformity of billing for identical clinical care


## **Are text inputs processed by MBVA stored, and how are they used by MBVA?**
MBVA does not use text inputs processed by the service for any reason other than to provide and maintain the service. Content processed by the service is not used to develop or improve the quality of MBVA and will not be stored on our side. You always retain ownership of your content and we will only use your content with your consent.


## **What do the outputs from MBVA mean?**
Once you submit medical notes and click on “Get ICDE Codes”, MBVA will display a list of Chapter, ICD-10 Code, Title, and Prediction Probability. The ICD code is a medical classification published by the World Health Organization and adopted by most countries. More details about ICD-10 code can be found <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/246208/1/9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a>.


## **What is MIMIC-III Dataset?**
MIMIC-III (‘Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care’) is a large, single-center database comprising information relating to patients admitted to critical care units at a large tertiary care hospital. Data includes vital signs, medications, laboratory measurements, observations and notes charted by care providers, fluid balance, procedure codes, diagnostic codes, imaging reports, hospital length of stay, survival data, and more. 
Prior to requesting access to MIMIC, all four of the project team members completed the CTIT “Data or Specimens Only Research” course, which discusses the data privacy and other sensitive issues related to the usage of this dataset.   


## **What are your rights in terms of accessing your own medical record?**
The regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)  protect the privacy and security of individuals’ identifiable health information and establish an array of individual rights with respect to health information. The Privacy Rule generally requires HIPAA covered entities (health plans and most health care providers) to provide individuals, upon request, with access to the protected health information (PHI) about them in one or more “designated record sets” maintained by or for the covered entity. This includes the right to inspect or obtain a copy, or both, of the PHI, as well as to direct the covered entity to transmit a copy to a designated person or entity of the individual’s choice.

## **What is Natural Language Processing?**
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a way for computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from textual information in a smart and useful way. By utilizing NLP, you can extract important phrases, sentiment, syntax, key entities such as brand, date, location, person, etc., and the language of the text.
